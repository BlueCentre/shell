- Component implementation guide
- Clear separation of concerns in docs structure

## 📊 Documentation Metrics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total documentation files | 12 |
| New files created | 3 |
| Documentation directories | 3 (setup, troubleshooting, development) |
| Quick reference links in README | 11 |
| Common task entries | 7 |

- ✅ Documentation index links to all files
- ✅ Cross-references between related docs
- ✅ External resource links included
- ✅ Relative paths used for portability

## 📝 Documentation Standards Applied

### Consistent Format

- **Audience indicator** at top of each guide
- **Last Updated** date on all new docs
- **Table of Contents** (implicit via headings)
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Command examples** with expected output
- **Emoji** for visual navigation (📚 📁 ✅ ❌ ⚠️)

### Content Structure

- **Overview/Why** section explaining purpose
- **Configuration** with examples
- **Verification** steps
- **Troubleshooting** guidance
