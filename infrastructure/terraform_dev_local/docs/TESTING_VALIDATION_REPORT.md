```

**Result:** ✅ Controller logs show successful IP allocation

#### Speaker Logs

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n metallb-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=speaker --tail=5
{"caller":"main.go:420","event":"serviceAnnounced","ips":["172.18.255.200"],"level":"info","msg":"service has IP, announcing","pool":"default-pool","protocol":"layer2"}
```

**Result:** ✅ Speaker logs show Layer 2 announcement working

### 8. Cleanup ✅

```bash
$ terraform destroy -auto-approve
Destroy complete! Resources: 7 destroyed.
```

**Result:** ✅ Clean teardown, all resources removed

## Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue #1: CRD Timing (FIXED ✅)

**Problem:** Initial `terraform apply` failed with:

```bash
Error: API did not recognize GroupVersionKind from manifest (CRD may not be installed)
no matches for kind "IPAddressPool" in group "metallb.io"
```

**Root Cause:** MetalLB CRDs are installed by the Helm chart, but Terraform tries to create IPAddressPool/L2Advertisement resources immediately. The CRDs may not be registered in the API server yet.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. Updated documentation to recommend two-stage apply:
   - Stage 1: `terraform apply -target=helm_release.metallb -auto-approve`
   - Stage 2: `terraform apply -auto-approve`
2. Added `field_manager { force_conflicts = true }` to kubernetes_manifest resources
3. Added new troubleshooting section (#7) documenting this issue
4. Updated setup guide with deployment instructions

**Files Updated:**

- `docs/setup/metallb.md` - Added two-stage deployment instructions
- `docs/troubleshooting/metallb.md` - Added issue #7 with solutions
- `helm_metallb.tf` - Added field_manager blocks

**Verification:** Two-stage deployment works flawlessly in testing.

## Recommendations

### For Users

1. **Use two-stage deployment** as documented for reliable results
2. **Verify Docker network range** before setting metallb_ip_range
3. **Wait for CRDs** if doing single-stage deployment (may need to run twice)
4. **Check logs** if issues occur - they're very informative

### For Future Improvements

1. ✅ **Documentation Updated** - Two-stage deployment documented
2. ✅ **Troubleshooting Enhanced** - Added CRD timing issue
3. ⚠️ **Consider sleep resource** - Could add time_sleep resource between Helm and manifests
4. ⚠️ **Alternative: Custom resource** - Could use null_resource with local-exec to wait for CRDs

## Addendum: Single-Stage Deployment Solution (October 2025)

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Two-stage deployment no longer required

### Summary

The CRD timing issue has been **completely resolved** by switching from `kubernetes_manifest` to `kubectl_manifest` provider combined with a `time_sleep` resource.

### Technical Solution

**Changed Code:**

```hcl
# Added time provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    time = {
      source  = "hashicorp/time"
      version = "~> 0.9"
    }
  }
}

# Added 30-second delay after MetalLB deployment
resource "time_sleep" "wait_for_metallb_crds" {
  count           = var.metallb_enabled ? 1 : 0
  depends_on      = [helm_release.metallb]
  create_duration = "30s"
}

# Switched from kubernetes_manifest to kubectl_manifest
resource "kubectl_manifest" "metallb_ipaddresspool" {
  count = var.metallb_enabled ? 1 : 0
  yaml_body = <<-YAML
    apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
    kind: IPAddressPool
    ...
  YAML
  depends_on = [
    helm_release.metallb,
    time_sleep.wait_for_metallb_crds
  ]
}
```

### Key Improvements

1. **`kubectl_manifest` vs `kubernetes_manifest`:**
   - `kubernetes_manifest` validates CRDs during **plan phase** (before they exist)
   - `kubectl_manifest` defers validation to **apply phase** (after CRDs are installed)

2. **Automatic timing with `time_sleep`:**
   - 30-second delay ensures CRDs are fully registered with Kubernetes API
   - Eliminates race conditions
   - Provides reliable single-command deployment

3. **Proper dependency chain:**

   ```markdown
   helm_release.metallb 
     → time_sleep.wait_for_metallb_crds 
       → kubectl_manifest resources
   ```

### Validation Results

**Single-stage deployment test:**

```bash
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
...
helm_release.metallb: Creating... [0s]
helm_release.metallb: Creation complete after 13s
time_sleep.wait_for_metallb_crds[0]: Creating... [0s]
time_sleep.wait_for_metallb_crds[0]: Still creating... [10s]
time_sleep.wait_for_metallb_crds[0]: Still creating... [20s]
time_sleep.wait_for_metallb_crds[0]: Creation complete after 30s
kubectl_manifest.metallb_ipaddresspool[0]: Creating... [0s]
kubectl_manifest.metallb_ipaddresspool[0]: Creation complete after 0s
kubectl_manifest.metallb_l2advertisement[0]: Creating... [0s]
kubectl_manifest.metallb_l2advertisement[0]: Creation complete after 1s
helm_release.istio_ingressgateway: Creating... [0s]
helm_release.istio_ingressgateway: Creation complete after 31s

Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

**Verification:**

```bash
$ kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway
NAME                   TYPE           EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   172.18.255.200   80:30227/TCP,443:30665/TCP

$ kubectl get ipaddresspool -n metallb-system
NAME           ADDRESSES
default-pool   ["172.18.255.200-172.18.255.250"]

$ kubectl get l2advertisement -n metallb-system
NAME         IPADDRESSPOOLS
default-l2   ["default-pool"]
```

✅ **All resources deployed successfully in single apply**  
✅ **LoadBalancer IP assigned correctly from MetalLB pool**  
✅ **No CRD timing errors**  
✅ **No two-stage deployment required**

### Updated Documentation

All documentation has been updated to reflect single-stage deployment:

- ✅ `docs/setup/metallb.md` - Simplified to single `terraform apply` command

- ✅ `QUICK_START.md` - Updated to show single-stage deployment with technical explanation

### Recommendations (Updated)

1. ~~Document the two-stage requirement~~ ❌ NO LONGER NEEDED
2. ~~Add troubleshooting guide for CRD timing~~ ✅ RESOLVED - Issue no longer occurs
3. ~~Consider automation for two-stage deployment~~ ❌ NO LONGER NEEDED
4. **NEW:** Use `kubectl_manifest` provider for all CRD-dependent resources ✅ IMPLEMENTED
5. **NEW:** Always include appropriate `time_sleep` delays after CRD installation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
